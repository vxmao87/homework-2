# Password Generator

A password generator that creates a password depending on user input. The generator takes into account whether the user wants to include uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers or special characters, and generates a password based on those criteria. The limit is 128 characters.

# Description of Design

The program uses JavaScript and takes advantage of for/while loops, along with many conditional statements and Object manipulation, especially in determining how many characters are left and how many of each character will be used.
